## A UI redesign of QB Core ATMs

    This is just a UI redesign of the QB-Core ATMs script:
   - [qb-atms](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-atms)
    
    This has been done by myself copying the style choices from my qb-banking redesign
    adapted from Scorpion.#5940 and implementing them into qb-atms so they match.
    
    I will not offer any support with this as I am a very busy person plus I am still
    early learning with .css and .js. Use this at your own risk. Currently I have had zero
    issues while running on Artifact: 5352, Game Build: 2372 and running latest build of
    qb-core framework as of 22/02/2022.
